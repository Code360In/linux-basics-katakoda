### creating files

We can create files in multiple ways/commands in Linux.As a basic we will use touch command to create the file.

syntax: touch <filename> --> This by default creates an empty file.

`touch sample notes.txt lambda.py`{{execute}} touch command can create multiple files at a single go as shown

`ls`{{execute}} Now you can use ls command to check the list of newly created files that you have just created using touch.
