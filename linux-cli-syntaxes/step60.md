### Change Directory



### Single dot (.)

Dot in linux indicates present working directory , you can use it in the commands which we have used so far

`ls`{{execute}} observe the names of the files

We will try cp command with the . option 

`cp /root/sample .`{{execute}}

`ls`{{execute}} 

Now if you compare the ouput from the previous ls you will be able to see the file with name sample in the present directory.
