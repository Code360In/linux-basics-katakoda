### Listing Files and Directories

ls is a Linux shell command that lists directory contents of files and directories.Some practical examples of ls command are shown below.

`ls`{{execute}} Get list of files and directories but it may not show 
hidden files.

`ls -A`{{execute}} Get list of hidden files and directories.

`ls -l`{{execute}} Get list of files with long format, usually shows properties of a file

`ls -Al`{{execute}} We can combine multiple options as well.

### NOTE: Giving multiple options depends on the command. ls accepts multiple options but it isn't applicable for all.
