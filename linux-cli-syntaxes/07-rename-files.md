## Renaming/Moving a File

In Linux, in order to change the name of a file we use `mv` command.

`Syntax: mv <source-file> <destination-file>`

`mv notes.txt note.txt`{{execute}}

You can check whether the file has been copied or not by referring `ls` command output.

`ls`{{execute}}

If destination exists it will overwrite the file and in some cases it will ask you for a prompt (yes/no) to overwrite the file or not.

mv command intention is to move the file from one location to another yet we use mainly to rename the files

`ls`{{execute}} 

you can observe that the notes.txt file has been renamed to sample.
