### Finding Files

Most of the times when you login you have no idea where the files are located at. Since Linux doesn't have an UI it would be a tedious job to traverse through all the directories to find a single file but linux provides find command to search for a file with the name.

Syntax: find <location-to-find> <search-criteria>
