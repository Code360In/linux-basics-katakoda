### Copying Files

To copy a file we have cp command. Alternatively we have rsync but mostly e prefer to use cp command in general.

Syntax: cp source-file destination-file

`cp notes.txt lam

If destination exists it will overwrite the file and in some cases it will ask you for a prompt (yes/no) to overwrite the file or not.
