## Removing Files

In Linux to remove files we have `rm`command, We can aslo use `unlink` command which does the same thing yet rm is widely preffered and used command.

`Syntax: rm <filename>`

`rm sample`{{execute}} 

It may ask you for a prompt (yes/no) to remove the files. You can supress the prompt by passing -f option in the command.

`ls`{{execute}} 

Now again when you list the files using ls command the sample file should be gone as you have removed it.

### Note: Be careful while removing a file as it deletes all the contents of the file and retireving the lost data is not possible in most of the cases.
