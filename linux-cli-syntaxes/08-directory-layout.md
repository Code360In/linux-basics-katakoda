## Linux Director

Alike any operating system Linux also has its own directory structure.

You can compare it with linux in the following diagram.

![Basic Connection](https://github.com/devopstrainings/linux-basics-katakoda/raw/master/linux-cli-syntaxes/images/linux-vs-windows-file-structure.png)

In windows, we use `\` (backslash) to give the path of a file or a directory but in Unix & Linux we use `/` (forward slash).

In Linux, we have a **ROOT DIRECTORY** where the path of any directory ends here. A simple forward slash `(/)` is called as a **ROOT DIRECTORY**.

Additionally, to the list of directories provided in the above diagram we have more and each and every default directory are under `/` have some purpose in the operating system.

Unlike Windows, Linux is Command line based OS, So if you want to move from one directory to another directory we would be using commands to get it done.
